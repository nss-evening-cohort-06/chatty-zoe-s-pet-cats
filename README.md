# Chatty Group Project

## ~~Requirements~~ Things we did:
* Use Bootstrap
* Complete 1 of the bonus items
* Balanced github contributions
* Completed Readme (^-^)
* No grunt errors
* Use Browserify

# Have you ever wanted to chat with aliens?
* Send a message to the aliens
* See other people's messages to the aliens
* Delete your message, because they are 14,000 lightyears away and will never see it
* You can also delete other people's messages, which means other people can delete your messages too...sorry
* __Abduction feature COMING SOON__

## What you gotta do:
Run this:

```
cd Workspace/group_projects/spa
git clone git@github.com:nss-evening-cohort-06/chatty-zoe-s-pet-cats.git
cd /lib
* maybe open a new tab here *
npm init (creates package.json file)
npm install grunt grunt-contrib-jshint matchdep grunt-contrib-watch jshint-stylish --save-dev (creates node_modules)
grunt
```
This will:
 - put all the files in the right place
 - make sure everything is linty-free
 - creat you a nice ```app.js``` file
 
 # THEN PHONE HOME
